Connect Lemrock with your:

- **Product catalog** (Google Merchant Center or HTTPS push)
- **Customer/CRM data** (CDP platforms: Mediarithmics, Salesforce Data Cloud)
- **Retail media platforms** (Criteo Retail Media, Mirakl Ads)

## How It Works

### Product Catalog (Required)

Your product catalog powers the AI shopping agent. Two options:

- **Google Merchant Center**: Fastest way to go live - automatic sync, no code
- **HTTPS Push**: Recommended for flexibility - push catalog updates on your schedule

### Retail Media (Monetization)

Connect Criteo or Mirakl Ads to display sponsored products in the chatbot and generate ad revenue.

### Customer Data (Optional)

Send customer segments from your CDP to personalize the AI agent based on loyalty tier, purchase history, and preferences.

## Integration Approach

- **Auth to Lemrock**: Single API key via `Authorization: Bearer <LEMROCK_API_KEY>`
- **Google catalog**: Service account linked to Merchant Center (no user-consent flow)
- **CDP/CRM**: HTTPS push (webhook style) from Mediarithmics & Salesforce Data Cloud to Lemrock
- **Retail media**: Criteo Direct Ad Server (Delivery API) with OAuth client credentials (Lemrock manages the token); Mirakl Ads: provide tenant API details (or use Criteo if Mirakl Ads is Criteo-powered)
