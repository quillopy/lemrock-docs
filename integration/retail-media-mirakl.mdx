Mirakl Ads tenants expose retail-media capabilities for marketplace/retail assortments. Integration differs by tenant.

## Criteo-Powered Setup

If your Mirakl Ads stack is **Criteo-powered**, reuse the **Criteo Delivery API** setup with your Mirakl Ads configuration.

No additional integration required.

## Native Mirakl Ads Setup

If using **native Mirakl Ads API** (not Criteo-powered):

Configure in Lemrock:
- **Tenant base URL** and **API key** ([Mirakl APIs use HTTPS + API key](https://developer.mirakl.net/))
- The **Sponsored Products** retrieval endpoint & required params (from your Mirakl Ads tenant docs)

## Display

Lemrock fetches and displays sponsored products in the chatbot.
