No code required on your side.

## Required Inputs

1. **Merchant Center ID** (`merchantId`)
2. **Service account JSON** (or the service account email so you can add it as a user)
3. Optional: country/language filters if you want a subset

## Access Grant Steps

1. In Google Cloud, create a **Service Account** and download the **JSON key**.
2. In **Merchant Center → Settings → Account access**, **add the service account email** as a user (Standard or Admin per your policy).
3. In Lemrock, configure:
   - Merchant Center **`merchantId`**
   - The **service account JSON** or confirm the SA email was added

## Sync Behavior

Lemrock will sync products via Content API (read-only):

- `GET https://shoppingcontent.googleapis.com/content/v2.1/{merchantId}/products` (paginated)
- Scope: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/content`
- Lemrock handles token refresh and incremental pulls

## Field Alignment

Product IDs in Merchant Center must match the IDs used with retail media platforms (Criteo, Mirakl Ads).
